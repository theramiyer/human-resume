I am part of the Infrastrucure as Code team under Windows Hosting. We built a solution based on Infrastrucure as Code principles to automate Windows Server builds and maintain immutable configuration on them.

- A green field solution that we built in-house, using PowerShell, Azure DevOps (including <span class='small-caps'>CI</span>/<span class='small-caps'>CD</span>), PowerShell <span class='small-caps'>DSC</span>, <span class='small-caps'>MS SQL</span>, Chocolatey, etc.
- We built the solution from scratch, finding the best possible solutions for the requirements, following best practices in the industry.
- We are a fully self-managed Agile team, who won the <span class='small-caps'>CIO</span>'s Excel award for efficienct automation using Infrastructure as Code.

- We are a multi-speciality team spread across three countries, who learn technologies as they become available and seem usable. We raise the bar at every opportunity and break barriers.
- I have been involved in automations involving <span class='small-caps'>REST</span> and <span class='small-caps'>SOAP API</span>s, including <span class='small-caps'>HPSM</span>, CyberArk, Infoblox, etc.
- We constantly collaborate with the other teams and interact with the Business to understand requirements and offer best possible solutions.
- We incorporate security best practices is into the <span class='small-caps'>DNA</span> of our solution, be it standards such as <span class='small-caps'>NIST</span> recommendations.
- I was also part of the core team that worked on the first ever Open House, and built and delivered the microsite within three days using Hugo, <span class='small-caps'>AWS S3</span>, CloudFront, Route53, GitLab and GitLab <span class='small-caps'>CI</span>, with User Experience at the forefront.
- I have often been engaged in various knowledge sharing activities such as internal trainings (my first one at Merck was in 2019, where we introduced several teams to PowerShell scripting---including the Messaging and Collaboration, Windows Operations, Information Security, IT Service Management and other teams) and guest lectures at colleges.
- Some of our initial scheduled automations were done on Jenkins, on which we set up several automation scripts to perform repetitive tasks.
- I am passionate about Communications. I was part of the Communications wing of the internal <span class='small-caps'>COVID</span> Task Force, have been part of the Comms Sounding Board, and am part of the Employee Engagement Focus Group's _Attract, Retain and Communicate_ section; I have hosted the townhall, Annual Excellence Awards, our internal podcast, etc.
