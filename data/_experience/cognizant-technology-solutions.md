I lead the offshore Infrastructure team for a renowned paper manufacturer in the US. I cut across the infrastructure fabric for the client, including VMware, Nutanix, Exchange, <span class='small-caps'>SCOM</span>, <span class='small-caps'>SCCM</span> and Citrix.

- I specialise in PowerShell; built modules, with tens of functions for backup, clean-up, auto-healing, auditing, and disaster recovery.
- I have led implementations of <span class='small-caps'><span class='small-caps'>SCOM</span></span>, <span class='small-caps'>SCCM</span>, Citrix XenApp 7.15, <span class='small-caps'>DMARC</span>, etc. Ask me about my experience with the projects.
- Recently, I accepted additional responsibility in Active Directory, File Services, VMware infrastructure, and Nutanix.
- I also trained fellow associates on PowerShell, helping them transition to automation teams across the organisation.

- Over the last year, I revisited and automated several audit reports, leading to over 36 hours a month saved in creating the reports. The simplification also reduced the time required to understand and leverage the data by about half.

#### Projects I drove and/or worked on

- Being passionate about automation, I created custom PowerShell modules that help teams reduce several weeks' worth of manual effort a year. These automation solutions include:
  - A script that performs automated, unattended disaster recovery using the Nutanix and PowerCLI modules.
  - A script that attempts to revive XenApp <span class='small-caps'>VDA</span> servers unregistered with the Controller, unattended, as though an administrator were reviving them.
  - Scripts to create inventory reports that take in data from various sources (VMware, Active Directory, even Excel) to intelligently identify gaps and perform unattended audits.
  - Scripts to create compliance reports, with input from various sources.
  - Scripts to ease Exchange administration.
  - Scripts that help other teams simplify their long-running tasks, such as user account termination.
- The server patch compliance in our environment was low. The reason for non-compliance was identified to be <span class='small-caps'>SME</span>s' availability for patching. We implemented automated patching to reduce manual intervention, which improved the patch compliance by 31%.
- In order to deter email spoofing, we implemented <span class='small-caps'>DMARC</span> in our environment. I helped set up <span class='small-caps'>DMARC</span> report analysis using _[dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/)_, and liaised with several teams to authorise partner domains to send emails on behalf of us.
- Servers in our environment were not monitored efficiently. As part of Wintel, I drove the implementation of <span class='small-caps'>SCOM</span>, starting from the sizing and design to setting up administrative practices.
- We had Compuware ClientVantage in our environment, which was deprecated. I helped size and design the environment for Solarwinds Web Performance Monitor, did a proof-of-concept, and finally, set up the transactions in order to help teams maintain an application availability of >99%.
- I drove the implementation of PowerWin, a Windows-Forms-and-PowerShell-based <span class='small-caps'>GUI</span> tool for Windows administration, for several clients, that helped speeding up troubleshooting and planning by up to 27%.
- Having eight years of exposure in Microsoft products, and especially, automation in them, I worked with several other teams in the Microsoft Community within Cognizant to help them with solutions for their clients.
