My current client is a renowned paper manufacturer in the US. I work as part of the Wintel Team, which initially handled the client’s Citrix and Exchange environments, but grew to be the largest contributor among all our IT teams to security update compliance, performance management, service improvement and automation.
- I helped our teams with custom PowerShell modules, with over 60 functions for
simplified hiring and termination, backup, clean-up and migration of data, capacity management, server healing, troubleshooting and auditing and disaster recovery.
- I led the implementation of SCOM, collaborating with the Windows Infrastructure team. Simultaneously, I also helped my team in the migration to
SCCM for updates; automated updates increased the update compliance by 31%.
- Over the last year, I revisited and automated several audit reports, leading to over 36 hours a month saved in creating the reports. The simplification also
reduced the time required to understand and leverage the data by about half.

#### Projects I drove and/or worked on

- Being passionate about automation, I created custom PowerShell modules that would help teams reduce several weeks' worth of manual effort a year. These automations include:
  - A script that performs automated, unattended disaster recovery using the Nutanix and PowerCLI modules.
  - A script that attempts to revive XenApp VDA servers unregistered with the Controller, unattended, as though an administrator were reviving them.
  - Scripts to create inventory reports that take in data from multiple locations to intelligently identify gaps.
  - Scripts to create compliance reports, with input from various sources.
  - Scripts to ease Exchange administration.
  - Scripts that help other teams simplify their long-running tasks, such as user account termination.
- In order to deter email spoofing, we implemented DMARC in our environment. I helped set up DMARC report analysis using _[dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/)_, and liaised with several teams to authorise partner domains to send emails on behalf of us.
- Servers in our environment were not monitored. As part of Wintel, I drove the implementation of SCOM, starting from the sizing and design to setting up administrative practices.
- We had Compuware ClientVantage in our environment, which was deprecated. I helped size and design the environment for Solarwinds Web Performance Monitor, did a proof-of-concept, and finally, set up the transactions in order to help teams maintain an application availability of >99%.
- I drove the implementation of PowerWin, a Windows-Forms-and-PowerShell-based GUI tool for Windows administration, for several clients, that helped speeding up troubleshooting and planning by up to 25%.
- Being passionate about Microsoft products, and especially, automation in them, I work with several other teams in the Microsoft Community within Cognizant to help them reduce manual effort and human errors, where possible.
