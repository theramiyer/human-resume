A few of us friends started a site, [Meraki Post](https://www.merakipost.com), initially set up on Blogger. When we needed flexibility and some freedom, I ported the site to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with its code hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), built using [GitLab&nbsp;CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/), hosted out of [AWS&nbsp;S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and delivered [securely](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) by [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). It helped us focus on performance and end user experience, with complete control over privacy. I also implemented [Slack](https://slack.com/) with custom integrations to streamline communication and monitoring. And I [podcast on Anchor](https://anchor.fm/merakipost) as well, when I find time.
