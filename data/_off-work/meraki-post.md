A few of us friends started a site, [Meraki Post](https://www.merakipost.com), initially set up on Blogger. When we needed flexibility and some freedom, I ported the site to Jekyll with its code hosted on GitLab, built using GitLab&nbsp;CI, hosted out of AWS&nbsp;S3, and delivered securely by CloudFront. It helped us focus on performance and end user experience. I also implemented Slack with custom integrations to streamline communication!
