- I tinker with some of the world-favourite dev boards, such as the Raspberry Pi 3/4, Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Pico, micro:bit, etc.
- I run my own Internet ad black-hole, media server, home storage solution and Docker, HomeAssistant on a Raspberry Pi; I am working on setting up a <span class='small-caps'>raid</span>-enabled <span class='small-caps'>nas</span> on it.
- Building this résumé from scratch using [Skeleton](https://github.com/bradfordlynch/Skeleton-framework-jekyll) was a small fun activity I took up, from writing the [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)-based pages, to setting up the build logic using [Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theramiyer/human-resume/).
- Writing is my passion, too. Links to my blogs, short stories and books are available on my homepage, [`https://ramiyer.me`](https://ramiyer.me).
