- I tinker with the world-favourite **Raspberry&nbsp;PI** (3&nbsp;B+, running Arch Linux, ARM). This device is currently our Media Server at home. I'm working on getting Alexa to run on it.
- Building this résumé from scratch using Skeleton Framework for Jekyll was a small fun activity I took up, from writing the Liquid-based pages, setting up custom build logic using Jekyll Collections... The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theramiyer/human-resume/).
- Writing is my passion, too. Links to my blogs, short stories and books are available on my homepage, [`https://ramiyer.me`](https://ramiyer.me).
