- I tinker with the world-favourite Raspberry PI 3 B+, running Arch Linux, (<span class='small-caps'>ARM</span>). This device is currently my Home Automation Server.
- Building this résumé from scratch using [Skeleton](https://github.com/bradfordlynch/Skeleton-framework-jekyll) was a small fun activity I took up, from writing the [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)-based pages, to setting up the build logic using [Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theramiyer/human-resume/).
- Writing is my passion, too. Links to my blogs, short stories and books are available on my homepage, [`https://ramiyer.me`](https://ramiyer.me).
